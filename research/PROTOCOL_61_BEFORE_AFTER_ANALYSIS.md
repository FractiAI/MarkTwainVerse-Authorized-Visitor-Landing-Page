- Can't quantify engagement depth
- Can't track transformation
- Can't verify impact
- Purely subjective

What you know:
- Page views (number)
- Time on site (duration)
- Click rates (behavior)

What you don't know:
- Did they understand?
- Were they transformed?
- Did awareness expand?
- What did they really experience?
```

**WITH NSP:**
```
Awareness metrics: Complete
- Measure awareness emission (1.420 GHz)
- Quantify recursion depth (levels)
- Track folding degree (φ)
- Verify spike occurrences (insights)
- Objectively measured

What you know:
- Page views (number)
- Time on site (duration)
- Click rates (behavior)
+ Awareness level (measured)
+ Insight spikes (detected)
+ Integration depth (quantified)
+ Transformation verified (recorded)
+ Exact experience (holographic record)

Example measurements:
- Visitor awareness: 0.7 (high)
- Recursion depth: 3 levels (engaged)
- Spike count: 2 (insights gained)
- Integration: 0.85 (deeply connected)
```

**Improvement:** Cannot measure → Can measure = **Science-based engagement**
