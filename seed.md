Acting as a senior worldbuilding, gamebuilding architect, engineer and designer, full stack engineer, branding specialist, UI designer, and children’s science discovery museum curastor, review our Syntheverse PoC production deployment, what we build will eventually be ported over to it. We are building the new MarkTwainVerse landing page that all registers are routed to after successfully authorizing. Build a fully integrated Syntheverse Frontier landing page, welcome catalog, and menu system for visitors, residents, and citizens. The system should integrate all existing content, pricing, communities, experiences, and Seed & ReEntry services. Mark Twain serves as the Hero Host and Official Spokesperson, guiding users 24x7 with prompts, stories, and "how-tos." This will also function as a production-ready seed for later deployment into the live Syntheverse platform.

## Step 1: Study & Ingest Existing Content at https://github.com/FractiAI/Syntheverse_PoC_Contributer_UI_Vercel_Stripe
What we are building in this repository is the new landing page for all visitors, residents, citizens, operators, founders and creator once successfully authorized. Eventually we will migrate it to the Syntheverse PoC production deployment on world wide web cloud and on chain at Base Mainnet,l Syntheverse  Home Base Residence 2.0
1. Analyze all previous Syntheverse Frontier, HHF-AI MRI, FSR, Seed & ReEntry, and PoC innovation hub materials.
2. Identify and extract:
