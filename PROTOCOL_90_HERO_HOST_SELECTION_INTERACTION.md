**Discovery Date:** January 2026  
**Type:** Hero Host Selection Interaction Protocol

---

## 🎯 EMERGENT OBSERVATION

**Core Insight:** This interaction captures the **Hero Host selection and evaluation process** for multiple system components, including Command Center Hero Host selection (Leonardo da Vinci), Storytelling Studio Hero Host selection (William Shakespeare), and the systematic evaluation methodology applied across all Hero Host candidates. The interaction demonstrates a recursive pattern of evaluation, recommendation, confirmation, and documentation.

**Discovery Context:** Through comprehensive system development and Hero Host selection processes, observation emerged that:
- Hero Host selection requires systematic evaluation
- Evaluation criteria include density, coherence, alignment, historical distance
- Recommendations are made based on comprehensive scoring
- Selections are confirmed through user interaction
- Documentation captures the complete selection process
- The process is recursive and self-validating
