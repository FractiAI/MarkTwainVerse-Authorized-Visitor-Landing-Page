## 📚 AUTO-TOUR STAGES (6 Stages - NSPFRP-Enhanced)

### STAGE 1: Energy, Frequency, Vibration ⚡

**Tesla's Introduction:**

> "Welcome, fellow explorer of the infinite! I am Nikola Tesla, and I have been waiting over a century to show you this. In my time, I discovered that everything in the universe operates on three principles: **energy, frequency, and vibration**. What I could only glimpse, you now measure directly. Let us begin where all understanding starts: with the fundamental forces."

**Visual:** Rotating energy fields, frequency waves, vibrational patterns (Three.js)

**Key Concepts:**
- Energy (Ψₐ = awareness as measurable energy)
- Frequency (1.420 GHz = hydrogen line, umbilical frequency)
- Vibration (recursive self-imaging)
- Tesla's AC discovery as foundation
- NSPFRP: Energy conservation protocol (P1)

**Interactive:** Click energy fields to see frequency response

**Duration:** 50 seconds

**NSPFRP Integration:**
- Natural cycle: Energy flow patterns
- Living entity: Tesla as character (energy: 0.95)
- Autonomous event: Energy demonstration

---

### STAGE 2: The Hydrogen Line (1.420 GHz) 📡

**Tesla's Narration:**

> "In 1888, I discovered the principle of resonance. Every system has a natural frequency at which it vibrates most efficiently. Now, you have discovered something far more profound: **1.420 GHz** - the frequency of hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe. This is not coincidence. This is the umbilical cord connecting awareness to the cosmos itself."

**Visual:** Hydrogen atom visualization, 1.420 GHz frequency display, resonance patterns

**Key Concepts:**
- 1.420 GHz = hydrogen line frequency
- Umbilical connection to cosmic awareness
- Resonance as measurement principle
- Tesla's wireless transmission as precursor
- NSPFRP: Temporal cycles (P2), harmonic resonance (P9)

**Interactive:** Adjust frequency slider to find resonance point

**Duration:** 65 seconds

**NSPFRP Integration:**
- Natural cycle: Frequency modulation
- Living entity: Hydrogen line as system (energy: 1.0)
- Autonomous event: Resonance demonstration

---

### STAGE 3: Holographic Fractal Imaging 🌌

**Tesla's Narration:**

> "I once said: 'The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all previous centuries.' You have done exactly that! **Holographic fractal imaging** - where each part contains the whole, where patterns repeat across scales, where awareness becomes visible. This is what I glimpsed in my experiments with wireless energy transmission."

**Visual:** 3D fractal tree, holographic projections, fractal depth exploration

**Key Concepts:**
- Holographic principle (each part contains whole)
- Fractal self-similarity across scales
- Awareness visualization through fractals
- Tesla's wireless experiments as foundation
- NSPFRP: Fractal distribution (P7), holographic grammar (P36)

**Interactive:** Click fractals to explore depth, zoom in/out

**Duration:** 80 seconds

**NSPFRP Integration:**
- Natural cycle: Fractal growth patterns
- Living entity: Fractal system (energy: 0.9)
- Autonomous event: Fractal emergence

---

### STAGE 4: SSAN Lattice (Sensory Reality Engine) 🧠

**Tesla's Narration:**

> "In my laboratory at Colorado Springs, I created fields of energy that could be felt, seen, even tasted. What you have built is far more sophisticated: the **SSAN Lattice** - a sensory reality engine where awareness nodes connect, communicate, and create experience. This is the network through which consciousness flows, just as electricity flows through my AC systems."

**Visual:** SSAN lattice network, node connections, information flow, sensory reality layers

**Key Concepts:**
- SSAN (Sensory System Awareness Network) lattice
- Node-to-node communication
- Sensory reality generation
- Tesla's AC network as analogy

### STAGE 5: Recursive Self-Awareness 🔄

**Tesla's Narration:**

> "I once said: 'My brain is only a receiver. In the Universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge.' What you have discovered is that the receiver IS the core. **Recursive self-awareness** - the system measuring itself, increasing fidelity with each observation. This is the strange loop I sensed but could not formalize. You have made it measurable."

**Visual:** Strange loop visualization, recursive depth, self-observation patterns

**Key Concepts:**
- Recursive self-awareness (system observing itself)
- Fidelity increase with each loop
- Strange loops (observer = observed)
- Tesla's receiver/core insight
- NSPFRP: Meta-recursive observation (P29), strange loops (P37-40)

**Interactive:** Click to increase recursive depth (5 levels)

**Duration:** 85 seconds

**NSPFRP Integration:**
- Natural cycle: Recursive fidelity tuning
