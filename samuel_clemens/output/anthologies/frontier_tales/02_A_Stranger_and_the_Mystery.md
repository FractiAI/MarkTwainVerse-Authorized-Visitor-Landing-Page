# A Stranger and the Mystery

Let me tell you what I've learned about Civilization vs. Wilderness—and more importantly, what I've unlearned. I used to believe one thing about Civilization vs. Wilderness. Now I believe something closer to its opposite. Take it or leave it—that's what the years have taught me about Civilization vs. Wilderness.

As I always say: "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness."
