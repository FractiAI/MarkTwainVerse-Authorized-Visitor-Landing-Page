# The the Frontier Adventure

There's a saying on the Mississippi: the river takes more than it gives. The Young Adventurer learned that truth. Between the shores, The Young Adventurer found space to think about Redemption's Long Road in ways never possible on land. When the journey ended, The Young Adventurer stepped ashore a different person. The river had worked its changes.

As I always say: "Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life."
