# A Contemplative Story

Nobody knows the river like The Treasure Hunter knew it—every bend, every sandbar, every secret. The river doesn't care about your plans. It flows where it will, and The Treasure Hunter had to flow with it. They say The Treasure Hunter was never quite the same after that voyage. But then, who would be?

As I always say: "The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why."
