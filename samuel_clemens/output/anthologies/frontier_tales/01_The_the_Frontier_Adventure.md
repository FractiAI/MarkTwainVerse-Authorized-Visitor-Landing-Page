# The the Frontier Adventure

There's something about Adventure's Call that the young can't understand. You have to live a while to see it clearly. I used to believe one thing about Adventure's Call. Now I believe something closer to its opposite. Take it or leave it—that's what the years have taught me about Adventure's Call.

As I always say: "The best way to cheer yourself is to try to cheer someone else up."
