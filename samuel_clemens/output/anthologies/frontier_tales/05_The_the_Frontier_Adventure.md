# The the Frontier Adventure

Something wasn't right at The Mississippi River. The Town Sheriff could feel it before there was proof. Every answer led to more questions. The Town Sheriff dug deeper, despite the warnings. When The Town Sheriff finally understood, everything made sense—terrible, perfect sense.

As I always say: "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do."
