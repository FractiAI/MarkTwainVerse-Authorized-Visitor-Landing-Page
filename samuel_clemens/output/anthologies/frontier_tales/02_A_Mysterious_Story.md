# A Mysterious Story

Something wasn't right at The Alpine Summit. The Riverboat Captain could feel it before there was proof. Every answer led to more questions. The Riverboat Captain dug deeper, despite the warnings. Some mysteries are better left unsolved. This wasn't one of them.

As I always say: "Habit is habit, and not to be flung out of the window by any man, but coaxed downstairs a step at a time."
