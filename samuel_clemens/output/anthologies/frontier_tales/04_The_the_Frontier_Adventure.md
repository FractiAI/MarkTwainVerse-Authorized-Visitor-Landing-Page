# The the Frontier Adventure

The river was running high when The Town Sheriff set out, like life itself pushing toward something new. The river doesn't care about your plans. It flows where it will, and The Town Sheriff had to flow with it. When the journey ended, The Town Sheriff stepped ashore a different person. The river had worked its changes.

As I always say: "The best way to cheer yourself is to try to cheer someone else up."
