# A Stranger's Journey

Did I ever tell you about The Treasure Hunter? No? Well, pull up closer to the fire. Now, The Treasure Hunter wasn't ordinary by any measure. Ask anyone who knew them. I say that's underselling it. Believe it or don't—but I was there, and I saw it with my own two eyes. Goodnight, now.

As I always say: "Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter."
