# A Stranger at the Frontier

Some folks are content to stay home. The Wandering Philosopher was not that kind of folk. Every obstacle at The Abandoned Mine seemed designed to turn The Wandering Philosopher back. Every obstacle failed. Some adventures change the world. This one changed The Wandering Philosopher—and that was enough.

As I always say: "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness."
