# A Stranger's Journey

It was on The Alpine Summit that The Treasure Hunter first learned what frontier life truly meant. What happened next would become legend in those parts. The Treasure Hunter faced trials that would break lesser souls. In the end, The Treasure Hunter understood what the old-timers meant about Civilization vs. Wilderness. Some lessons only the frontier can teach.

As I always say: "I have never let my schooling interfere with my education."
