# A Stranger at the Frontier

Gather 'round, because this tale about The Wandering Philosopher is one you won't believe—until you do. What The Wandering Philosopher did next would make a lesser storyteller refuse to tell it. But I'm not a lesser storyteller. And that, friends, is the honest truth about The Wandering Philosopher. Well, mostly honest. The fire's burning low, so that'll have to do.

As I always say: "Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see."
