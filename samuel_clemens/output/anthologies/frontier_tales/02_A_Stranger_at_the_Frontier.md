# A Stranger at the Frontier

Nobody knows the river like The Town Sheriff knew it—every bend, every sandbar, every secret. Mile after mile, the current carried them forward. And with each mile, The Town Sheriff understood a little more. When the journey ended, The Town Sheriff stepped ashore a different person. The river had worked its changes.

As I always say: "Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear—not absence of fear."
