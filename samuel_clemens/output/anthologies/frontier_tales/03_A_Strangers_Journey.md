# A Stranger's Journey

Nobody knows the river like The Town Sheriff knew it—every bend, every sandbar, every secret. Between the shores, The Town Sheriff found space to think about Adventure's Call in ways never possible on land. The river gave The Town Sheriff exactly what was needed—not what was wanted, but what was needed.

As I always say: "Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear—not absence of fear."
