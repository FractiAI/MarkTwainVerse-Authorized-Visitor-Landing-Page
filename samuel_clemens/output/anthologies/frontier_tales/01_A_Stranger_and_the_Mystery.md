# A Stranger and the Mystery

Let me tell you what I've learned about Human Connection—and more importantly, what I've unlearned. I used to believe one thing about Human Connection. Now I believe something closer to its opposite. In the end, Human Connection is simpler than we make it. And harder than we admit.

As I always say: "Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence in society."
