# A Humorous Story

Now, I'm going to tell you about The Riverboat Captain, and every word of this is true—mostly. The thing about The Riverboat Captain was this: nothing was ever simple, and everything was twice as big. And that, friends, is the honest truth about The Riverboat Captain. Well, mostly honest. The fire's burning low, so that'll have to do.

As I always say: "Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life."
