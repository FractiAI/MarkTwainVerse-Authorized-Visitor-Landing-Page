# A Stranger and the Mystery

Something wasn't right at The Mississippi River. The Treasure Hunter could feel it before there was proof. Piece by piece, the puzzle came together. And the picture it made was unsettling. The truth about The Mississippi River changed everything. And The Treasure Hunter had to decide what to do with it.

As I always say: "Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear—not absence of fear."
