# The Tale of A Stranger

Gather 'round, because this tale about The Riverboat Captain is one you won't believe—until you do. What The Riverboat Captain did next would make a lesser storyteller refuse to tell it. But I'm not a lesser storyteller. Believe it or don't—but I was there, and I saw it with my own two eyes. Goodnight, now.

As I always say: "Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence in society."
