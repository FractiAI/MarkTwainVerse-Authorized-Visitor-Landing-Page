# A Stranger at the Frontier

The map showed The Innovation Hub, but what it didn't show was the danger—and the glory. Every obstacle at The Innovation Hub seemed designed to turn The Town Sheriff back. Every obstacle failed. Some adventures change the world. This one changed The Town Sheriff—and that was enough.

As I always say: "Continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection."
